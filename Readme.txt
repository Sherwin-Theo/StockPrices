This project aimed to develop a predictive model for stock closing prices. By leveraging historical stock data sourced from Kaggle, the project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms. Linear regression, XGBoost Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor were employed to generate predictions. While the models provided initial results, further analysis and experimentation are necessary to enhance accuracy and uncover meaningful insights. Future directions may include exploring additional features, refining model architectures, and incorporating time series analysis techniques.
